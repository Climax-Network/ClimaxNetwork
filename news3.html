    <p class="newstitle">Catholic Charities</p>
    <p class="newsinfo">Catholic Charities is a place in Colorado Springs that gives people food when they need it. Catholic charities have programs to fight hunger, such as allowing people to pick their own food. 
      According to the organization ,” Our goal is to help each person achieve stability,”They would like it to be done as soon as possible. 
      The organization works with Springs rescue mission, Government, and partners and housing to complete their goal. They are doing this to make sure no one gets hungry.
 They are able to do this by volunteers because people can donate to Catholic Charities so they can get food for people that need it.Catholic Charities had a problem with donations because people did not want to donate.
  They did not want to because they thought it was fake.
Catholic charities use soup kitchens because according to the text,”Steve Handen, who died last month. He was the man who began feeding the poor out of his home in Colorado Springs in the 1970s.
 As that ministry grew, it moved to the basement of First Baptist Church and ultimately to the Marian House, where it lives on today.” 
	 Catholic Charities has an event called St.Pat's Gala which lets people auction and they made $280,000 dollars to help people.</p>
