        <p>Care and Share Food Bank is an organization ment to help other get food for free 
          and feed other due to hunger and as you know 
          hunger is a huge problem in today's society. So Care and Share decided to 
          create a food drive called the Harvest of Love. This food drive allows 
          schools and other companies to collaborate and help donate food to feed others.
           This can proove to be very helpful because of stock prices going up it can cause
          lots of people to not be able to purchase food. It can also teach kids that donating
         to things like charities or food companies can imapct other's live's in a very positive way.</p>

        <p>In order to be able to achive the goals of Care and Share you can Volunteer or donate food to the organization to help support them and help poeple accross Colorado.
          This can be done and can possibly end homelessness and less hunger.
          If you donate $1 you can be giving people 6 cans of food to eat on.
          Yes $1 dollar gives them that much food and this can help them live through out the year and possibly even longer.
          Donating is very simple by going to their website shown below this story.
