          Fresh Start Center is an organization fighting hunger in Colorado Springs every month. 
          They believe that no one should have to decide between being healthy and being fed. 
          They have many programs to fight hunger that are currently in operation. 
          They have a program where volunteers go around and distribute healthy food to those who need it. 
          According to the Fresh Start Center website, “they say that ‘it always starts with food.
          According to an anonymous employee at Fresh Start Center, they have raised garden beds and an entire greenhouse, dedicated to growing the food that they distribute. 
          They also work with grocery stores to get food. They get the food from the stores when the store feels like a product that fits the center’s nutritional criteria won't be sold at their store for a while, they give it to the center.

          They also have a program that teaches people which foods are and aren't nutritious and healthy for the human body. Much like the rest of the world, they were heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
          Due to the grocery stores shutting down, they didn't get as much of the food that they distributed during their program. This greatly slowed their efforts to help people in need of quality food. 
          They also couldn't teach about quality food because no one could go anywhere. 
     You can help them fight hunger by donating money to them, starting a food drive, or going into their building. They are open to the public on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
     Their goal is to show that hunger is anywhere and that it needs to be ended. An employee said that the center always says that, “hunger is everywhere. It could be happening to your friend and you don’t even realize it.” 
     The same employee also said that they will know they have completed their goal of ending hunger when “a family who we once supported comes in and supports us.”
